# Chemistry
This was a project we were making for the CRAb group of the Federal University of Fortaleza.
The project was about modelling 3D atoms in OpenGL, in a way that public schools could run this simulator on low-end computers.

# What was made:
- Modelling for atoms and it's connections.
- General data structures for the elements of the scene.
- Just by the position of the atoms, the connections between them would adjust correctly.

# So... what?
The project has transformed into another one involving a game engine, so this repository is no long being updated.
